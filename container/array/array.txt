std::array
offered a better alternative for C-style arrays

    Array classes knows its own size, whereas C-style arrays lack this property. So when passing to functions, we don’t need to pass size of Array as a separate parameter.
    With C-style array there is more risk of array being decayed into a pointer. Array classes don’t decay into pointers
    Array classes are generally more efficient, light-weight and reliable than C-style arrays.

Operations on array :- 
1. at() :- This function is used to access the elements of array. 
2. get() :- This function is also used to access the elements of array. This function is not the member of array class but overloaded function from class tuple. 
3. operator[] :- This is similar to C-style arrays. This method is also used to access array elements.    
4. front() :- This returns reference to  the first element of array. 
5. back() :- This returns reference to the last element of array.
6. size() :- It returns the number of elements in array. This is a property that C-style arrays lack. 
7. max_size() :- It returns the maximum number of elements array can hold i.e, the size with which array is declared. The size() and max_size() return the same value.
8. swap() :- The swap() swaps all elements of one array with other. 
 9. empty() :- This function returns true when the array size is zero else returns false. 
10. fill() :- This function is used to fill the entire array with a particular value.
