std::priority_queue

specifically designed such 
that the first element of the queue is either the greatest or the smallest of all elements in the queue, 
and elements are in non-increasing or non-decreasing order 
(hence we can see that each element of the queue has a priority {fixed order}).

In C++ STL, the top element is always the greatest by default. 
We can also change it to the smallest element at the top. 

priority_queue::empty() 	Returns whether the queue is empty.
priority_queue::size()  	Returns the size of the queue.
priority_queue::top() 	Returns a reference to the topmost element of the queue.
priority_queue::push()  	Adds the element ‘g’ at the end of the queue.
priority_queue::pop() 	Deletes the first element of the queue.
priority_queue::swap() 	Used to swap the contents of two queues provided the queues must be of the same type, although sizes may differ.
priority_queue::emplace() 	Used to insert a new element into the priority queue container.
priority_queue value_type  	Represents the type of object stored as an element in a priority_queue. It acts as a synonym for the template parameter.
