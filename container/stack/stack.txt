std::stack
    LIFO(Last In First Out) type of working, 
    where a new element is added at one end (top) and an element is removed from that end only.

    Stack uses an encapsulated object of 
    either vector or deque (by default) or list (sequential container class) as its underlying container

empty() – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity : O(1) 
size() – Returns the size of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
top() – Returns a reference to the top most element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
push(g) – Adds the element ‘g’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
pop() – Deletes the most recent entered element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1)
