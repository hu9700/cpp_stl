std::multiset

similar to the set, 
with the exception that multiple elements can have the same values.

    begin() – Returns an iterator to the first element in the multiset –>  O(1)
    end() – Returns an iterator to the theoretical element that follows the last element in the multiset –> O(1)
    size() – Returns the number of elements in the multiset –> O(1)
    max_size() – Returns the maximum number of elements that the multiset can hold –> O(1)
    empty() – Returns whether the multiset is empty –> O(1)
    insert (x) – Inserts the element x in the multiset –> O(log n)
    clear () – Removes all the elements from the multiset –> O(n)
     erase(x) – Removes all the occurrences of x –> O(log n)


Removing Element From Multiset Which Have Same Value:
    a.erase() – Remove all instances of element from multiset having the same value
    a.erase(a.find()) – Remove only one instance of element from multiset having same value
