std::multimap

Multimap is similar to a map with the addition that multiple elements can have the same keys. 
Also, it is NOT required that the key-value and mapped value pair have to be unique in this case. 

One important thing to note about multimap is that multimap keeps all the keys in sorted order always. 
These properties of multimap make it very much useful in competitive programming.

Some Basic Functions associated with multimap: 

    begin() – Returns an iterator to the first element in the multimap
    end() – Returns an iterator to the theoretical element that follows last element in the multimap
    size() – Returns the number of elements in the multimap
    max_size() – Returns the maximum number of elements that the multimap can hold
    empty() – Returns whether the multimap is empty
    pair<int,int> insert(keyvalue,multimapvalue) – Adds a new element to the multimap
