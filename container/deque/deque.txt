std::deque
Double-ended queues

are more efficient in case of insertion and deletion of elements. 
Unlike vectors, contiguous storage allocation may not be guaranteed. 

Double-ended queues are a special case of queues 
where insertion and deletion operations are possible at both the ends.

The functions for deque are same as vector, 
with an addition of push and pop operations for both front and back.
